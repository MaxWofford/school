Ceteris Paribus - All things held constant

Markets bring buyers and sellers together
forces of supply and demand work together to establish prices.
prices form the basis of economic decisions.

SURPLUS - price is too high
SHORTAGE - price is too low
^imposible without government

PRICEFLOOR - artificial set price to set a minimum price for a good or service 
PRICECEILING - artificial set maximum price for a good or service

NORMAL GOODS: average goods
SUPERIOR GOODS: 
INFERIOR GOODS: demand of inferior goods directly porportional to price of normal subsitute

ELASTICITY OF DEMAND: a measure of how consumers respond to price changes
	-Elastic - sensetive to price change (due to substitutes)
	-Inelastic - not very sensetive to price change (due to lack of substitutes)
	-Unitary Elastic - 1-1 ratio between price & quantity
Effects on Elasticity
	-availability of substitute goods (many subst, high elastic)
	-Relative Importance (wants have high elastic)
	-Change over time (longer time span, high elastic) <- Due to search cost
	-Necessities vs. Luxuries (luxuries, high elastic)
PERFECTLY ELASTIC
	- Hyper-competition
PERFECTLY INELASTIC
	- Usually lifesaving goods
LAW of DIMINISHING MARGINAL UTILITY: utility gained from product is worse
LAW of DIMINISHING RETURNS:cost of production slowly overtakes benefits
	-Eventually leads to NEGATIVE MARGINAL RETURNS
FIXED COST: always present (rent, repair, taces, salaries of workers)
VARIABLE COST: can dip or rise (resources, some labor)
OPTIMIZED is where MR=MC
