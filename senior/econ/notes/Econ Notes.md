`Ceteris Paribus` All things held constant

Markets bring buyers and sellers together
forces of supply and demand work together to establish prices.

* Prices form the basis of economic decisions.

`SURPLUS`  price is too high

`SHORTAGE`  price is too low

* Shortage is impossible without government

`PRICE FLOOR`  artificial set price to set a minimum price for a good or service.

`PRICE CEILING`  artificial set maximum price for a good or service.

`NORMAL GOODS` average goods

`SUPERIOR GOODS` 

`INFERIOR GOODS` demand of inferior goods directly proportional to price of normal substitute

`ELASTICITY OF DEMAND` a measure of how consumers respond to price changes.

* `Elastic`  sensitive to price change (due to substitutes).

* `Inelastic`  not very sensitive to price change (due to lack of substitutes).

* `Unitary Elastic`  1-1 ratio between price & quantity.

Effects on Elasticity

* Availability of substitute goods (many subst, high elastic)
* Relative Importance (wants have high elastic)
* Change over time (longer time span, high elastic) <- Due to search cost
* Necessities vs. Luxuries (luxuries, high elastic)

`PERFECTLY ELASTIC`

* Hyper-competition

`PERFECTLY INELASTIC`

* Usually lifesaving goods

`LAW of DIMINISHING MARGINAL UTILITY` Utility gained from product is worse

`LAW of DIMINISHING RETURNS` Cost of production slowly overtakes benefits

* Eventually leads to NEGATIVE MARGINAL RETURNS

`FIXED COST` Always present (rent, repair, taxes, salaries of workers)

`VARIABLE COST` Can dip or rise (resources, some labor)

`OPTIMIZED` is where MR=MC




CHAPTER 7
===
Different types of Market Structures

`MARKETS` are where buyers and sellers

* meet to exchange goods and services

* are affected by some level of competition

Barriers to entry
***

* Cost

* Technology 


Market Structures
***

* `Pure (Perfect) Competition` Price is all that matters; Opposite of monopoly

- Completely theoretical
- LARGE number of SMALL firms
- Identical products
- Unlimited Competition
- No Barriers to Entry
- Each firm is a Price-Taker


* `Monopolistic Competition`

* `Oligopoly`

* `Monopoly`
