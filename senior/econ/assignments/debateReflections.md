Pennies: Though they prevent inflation, the penny is a large burden on our economy (though miniscule compared to the wars we are in). Some suggest melting them down and some suggest making them out of cheaper materials. Cheaper materials will only work for so long, as the relative price of the penny will forever fall, and the number of pennies needed in production is always in decline. I suggest the dime is rescaled to be much larger, while reducing the value of its material to ensure it retains its original value. These larger dimes would have perferations in their centers allowing them to be devided into 10 pieces, which would be the new pennies.

Gold Standard: By taking us off the gold standard, we prevented our economy from being tied to the price of gold. It also smooths out the ups and downs of inflation in a market cycle because the government can print the exact ammount of money it wants, instead of has gold for. This stabalization (similar to a PID loop) is a feedback loop that ensures the economy is less vulnerable to depressions.
