(title) The Consitution, more then a law code.


Hook w/ famous quote
We the People of the United States...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. The masons in the audience, just like the 313.9 million other American citizens should (I hope) recognize these famous, world-changing words. They begin the 4,440 word document that our nation's core principals were founded on. But how often do we consider just how ground-breaking this document is?


Thesis: The Constitution is one of America's most universally acclaimed(?) documents. It set forth a lawcode that supported a fledgling nation from its early days to the superpower it has become. But the constitution is more than just a legal code; it sets forth a civil and cultural standard of freedom that is at the core of American society.


At the time of the Constitution's drafting, . The idea of natural rights had existed for some time, but never before had they been in a lawcode "for the people". 

the consitution is responsive (Constitution was a second try at nation's law code, so they made it alterable)

The constitution is an idea, and a golden standard for how our contry can work (it transcends simply being a law code)

Indeed, the very features which made it unique have also contributed to its longevity
