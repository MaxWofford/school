(title) The Consitution, more then a law code.


Hook w/ famous quote
We the People of the United States...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. The masons in the audience, just like the 313.9 million other American citizens should (I hope) recognize these famous, world-changing words.

The constitution is an idea, and a golden standard for how our country can work (it transcends simply being a law code)The Constitution is one of America's most universally acclaimed(?) documents. It set forth a law-code that supported a fledgling nation from its early days to the superpower it has become. But the constitution is more than just a legal code; it sets forth a cultural standard of freedom that is at the core of American society.
