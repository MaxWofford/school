(title) The Consitution, more then a law code.


Hook w/ famous quote
We the People of the United States...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. The masons in the audience, just like the 313.9 million other American citizens should (I hope) recognize these famous, world-changing words. They begin the 4,440 word document that our nation's core principals were founded on. But how often do we consider just how ground-breaking this document is?

Hello. I'm Max Wofford, a senior at El Segundo High School. Like many of you, law-codes aren't something I think about on a daily basis. The constitution, however, is different. So how is it a 200 year old document has stayed as relevant today as it was the day it was drafted?  The first thing to consider when thinking about the Constitution is that it was not our nation's first law code. Our founding fathers were not perfect, and the first attempt at a law-code had left the fledgling nation's government unstable. Benjamin Franklin once said "From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected?" Instead of trying to make the next law-code perfect, the Constitutional Convention drafted a lawcode for a "more-perfect Union" which could ammend itself as times change. They knew there is no such thing as a perfect lawcode because times change, so they made a lawcode that would change with the times. 


At the time of the Constitution's drafting the idea of natural rights had existed for some time, but never before had there been a law-code "for the people". This ground-breaking concept that a government is owned by its people -no the other way around- has been a core principal of not only America, but of many other countries following in America's footsteps.


The constitution is an idea, and a golden standard for how our country can work (it transcends simply being a law code)The Constitution is one of America's most universally acclaimed(?) documents. It set forth a law-code that supported a fledgling nation from its early days to the superpower it has become. But the constitution is more than just a legal code; it sets forth a cultural standard of freedom that is at the core of American society. 


Indeed, the very features which made it unique also contribute to its longevity.
