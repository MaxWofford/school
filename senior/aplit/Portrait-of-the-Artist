In many great literary works the historical and/or social background is so integral to the meaning of the work as a whole that the novel could not have been set in any other time or place. On the other hand, a great Bildungsromans can transcend time and place, providing insight into what it means to be human. In a 3 to 4 page analysis, discuss how 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' fulfills both these qualities of great literature. In what ways is it an Irish novel; what makes this novel quintessentially human? What is the meaning of the work as a whole? 


Intro: Humans have a shared experience through life. Some sentiments transcend time and space. Many literary {stream of conciousness/ Bildungsromans} classics tap into this shared experience, and their stories transcend the settings they take place in. 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man', by James Joyce, is a truely great Bildungsromans, however, it is also an inherently Irish novel. This duplicitous state of existance (both a Bildungsromans and a time piece) hint at a deep tie between the setting and plot of 'Portrait of the Artist'

Thesis: Through the inately human actions and interactions that Stephen experiences in his journey through adolecence, his life is tied with the land he lives in.


Irish novel:
Specific examples of how human actions 

"Trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which Stephen lent an avid ear."

"Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow."

"When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets"


Human novel:
Stephen has many human flaws
References to ideas that many humans have

"When you wet the bed first it is warm and then it gets cold."

"Words which he did not understand he said over and over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended"

"The causes of his embitterment were many, remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret."
