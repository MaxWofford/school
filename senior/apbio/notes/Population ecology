Population ecology
---

Density and dispersion patterns
===
	*Clumped [most common in nature]
	*Uniform [due to interspecies interaction]
	*Random []

Visual representations of populations
===
Life tables
Survivorship curves
	*Type I [survivability decreases]
	*Type II [survivabilitiy is constant]
	*Type III [survivability increases]

Growth models
	*Exponential [no limiting factor] G = rN
	*Logistic [with limiting factor] G = rN((K-N) / K)

[Carrying capacity] maximum sustainable population due to environmental limiting factors
