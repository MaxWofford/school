Population ecology
---

Density and dispersion patterns
===
	*Clumped [most common in nature]
	*Uniform [due to interspecies interaction]
	*Random []

Visual representations of populations
===
Life tables
Survivorship curves
	*Type I [survivability decreases]
	*Type II [survivabilitiy is constant]
	*Type III [survivability increases]

Growth models
	*Exponential [no limiting factor] G = rN
	*Logistic [with limiting factor] G = rN((K-N) / K)

[Carrying capacity] maximum sustainable population due to environmental limiting factors

[Limiting factors] environmental factor that limits sustainable population size. Can be either density dependent or independent.
	
[Density dependent] Population size is a factor
	* Food (Nutrients)
	* Space (according to textbook "like a game of musical chairs")
	* Physiological factors (stress from overcrowding)

[Density independent] 
	* Weather (seasonal)

Population cycles
===
Limiting factors cause "boom and bust" cycles because nature has no PID loop

[Life history] traits that affect an organism's schedule of reproduction and death
